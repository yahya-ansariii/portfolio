							<p>The BAJA SAE Series is an event for the undergraduate engineering students, organized globally by the Society of Automotive Engineers, USA. The BAJA SAE tasks the students to design, fabricate and validate a single seater four - wheeled off road vehicle to take part in series of events spread over a course of 3 days that test the vehicle for the sound engineering practices that have gone into it, the agility of the vehicle in terms of gradability, speed, acceleration and manoeuvrability characteristics and finally its ability to endure that back breaking durability test.

							It was the first time that the team decided to use a continuously variable transmission (CVT). The transmission system was successfully designed with a Polaris CVT coupled with a single speed reduction gearbox.
							The role I performed in the team was a designer in the engine and transmission department.
